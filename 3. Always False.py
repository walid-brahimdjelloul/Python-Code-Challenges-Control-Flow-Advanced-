## There are some situations that you normally want to avoid when programming using conditional statements. One example is a contradiction. This occurs when your condition will always be false no matter what value you pass into it. Letâ€™s create an example of a function that contains a contradiction.
# Write your always_false function here:
def always_false(num):
  if (num > -8 or num < 6):
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your always_false function:
print(always_false(-7))
# should print False
print(always_false(-1))
# should print False
print(always_false(1))
# should print False
