## We want to create a function that will help us rate movies. Our function will split the ratings into different ranges and tell the user how the movie was based on the movieâ€™s rating.
# Write your movie_review function here:
def movie_review(rating):
  if (rating <= 5):
    return "Avoid at all costs!"
  elif (rating > 5 and rating < 9 ):
    return "This one was fun."
  else:
    return "Outstanding!"
# Uncomment these function calls to test your movie_review function:
print(movie_review(9))
# should print "Outstanding!"
print(movie_review(4))
# should print "Avoid at all costs!"
print(movie_review(6))
# should print "This one was fun."
